              Who I am
            </h1>
            As of 2022 I've begun switching from tech-support, to tech-create.
            <br />
            <br />
            Having previous experience in Programming making plugins for older
            games in lua API's, I have now made a number of sites with React and
            JS
            <br /> <br />
            My main site can be found{" "}
            <a
              href="http://aze-m.com"
              target="_blank"

            >
              here!
            </a>
            <br />
            It has a private codebase, as well as implementation of a few
            express.js backends which are closed off to outside requests.
            <br />
            <br />
            Always the quick learner I have also made a blog reader App in React
            Native, which grabs the Posts from my main site and transforms them
            into the CSS-Less display of Native.
            <br />
            <br />
            The entire project including learning styling in Native and Native
            Elements took roughly 4 hours and can be found on{" "}

            Everything I write has a high emphasis on being readable later, from
            variables to funciton names. <br />
            <br />
            This makes debugging much easier, as well as letting me refactor
            with less issues <br />
            <br />
            Currently I have coded in and with:

            This is rather rare right now since I have a few projects I am
            working on in my spare time as well as my actual spare time
            activities like gaming.

            There is various ways to reach me, if you have a job offer or just
            have questions.
            <br />
            <br />
            First:{" "}

            These always get read and usually responded to withing a few days.{" "}

            Effectively the same as sending me an E-Mail, as I will get one from
            linked in's automation.
            <br />
            <br />
